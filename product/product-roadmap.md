# Product Roadmap

## Sections

### 1. Prompt Library
The core workspace where experts author, organize, and manage prompt fragments as a filesystem-based taxonomy of .md files.

### 2. Agent Builder
The control panel where users select domains and fill out auto-generated forms to configure and instantiate specialized agents.

### 3. Agent Runtime
Deploy, test, and monitor live agents — view generated system prompts, run conversations, and track agent performance.

### 4. Tool Library
Browse, install, and configure function-calling tools that agents can use — including built-in DomainSmith tools and npm-installable packages, with workspace-level environment variable management.

### 5. Workspaces
Manage users, permissions, and shared environments for collaborative agent development across teams and domains.
