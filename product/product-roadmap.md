# Product Roadmap

## Sections

### 1. Prompt Library
The core workspace where experts author, organize, and manage prompt fragments as a filesystem-based taxonomy of .md files.

### 2. Agent Builder
The control panel where users select domains and fill out auto-generated forms to configure and instantiate specialized agents.

### 3. Flow Builder
A visual flow editor within Agent Builder that allows users to create sequential task flows. Each task can output structured data via JSON schemas, call tools, transform data from previous tasks, or generate LLM responses. Tasks pass data linearly to the next task in the sequence.

### 4. Agent Runtime
Deploy, test, and monitor live agents — view generated system prompts, run conversations, and track agent performance.

### 5. Tool Library
Browse, install, and configure function-calling tools that agents can use — including built-in DomainSmith tools and npm-installable packages, with workspace-level environment variable management.

### 6. Workspaces
Manage users, permissions, and shared environments for collaborative agent development across teams and domains.
