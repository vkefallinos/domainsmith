# Data Shape

## Entities

### PromptFragment

An isolated .md file containing a specific piece of agent behavior, knowledge, or constraint (e.g., tone rules, domain knowledge, output restrictions).

### Directory

A folder in the taxonomy that organizes related prompt fragments, with an optional config.json that defines metadata and structure rules.

### Schema

A JSON Schema automatically generated from a directory tree, mapping the hierarchical structure to a type-safe form definition.

### AgentConfig

A JSON payload generated from user form input, representing the exact configuration choices for an agent instance.

### Agent

A deployed or runnable agent instance with its assembled system prompt, ready for conversation.

### Workspace

A shared or isolated environment containing prompt libraries and agents, with access controls for collaboration.

### User

A domain expert or end user who can author prompt fragments, configure agents, or interact with deployed agents.

### Conversation

A chat session with an agent, containing messages exchanged between the user and the agent over time.

### Tool

A function-calling capability that agents can invoke — either a built-in DomainSmith tool or an installed npm package.

### ToolPackage

An npm package that can be installed to add tools to the Tool Library, with metadata about available functions and dependencies.

### EnvironmentVariable

A workspace-level configuration value (API keys, endpoints, secrets) that tools can reference for secure credential management.

### Flow

A sequential task flow that can be attached to an agent, consisting of multiple tasks that execute in order. Tasks share a mutable flow output object that accumulates data across execution. Flows are triggered by slash commands during conversations.

### Task

A single step within a flow of type updateFlowOutput or executeTask. updateFlowOutput tasks store structured LLM output at a target field in the flow state. executeTask tasks perform operations (tool calls, prompt fragments) without adding structured LLM output to the flow state. Both task types can enable prompt fragments, enable tools, and define task instructions.

### SlashCommand

A custom command trigger (e.g., `/summarize`, `/analyze`) that users can type in conversation to invoke an attached flow on an agent.
