# One-Shot Implementation Prompt

I need you to implement a complete web application based on detailed UI designs and product specifications I'm providing.

## Instructions

Please carefully read and analyze the following files:

1. **@product-plan/product-overview.md** — Product summary with sections and entity overview
2. **@product-plan/instructions/one-shot-instructions.md** — Complete implementation instructions for all milestones

After reading these, also review:
- **@product-plan/design-system/** — Color and typography tokens
- **@product-plan/data-shapes/** — UI data contracts (the shapes of data the components expect)
- **@product-plan/shell/** — Application shell components
- **@product-plan/sections/** — All section components, types, sample data, and test specs

## Before You Begin

Review all the provided files, then ask me clarifying questions about:

1. **My tech stack** — What framework, language, and tools I'm using, and any existing codebase conventions
2. **Authentication & users** — How users should sign up, log in, and what permissions exist
3. **Product requirements** — Anything in the specs or user flows that needs clarification
4. **Anything else** — Whatever you need to know before implementing

Lastly, ask me if I have any additional notes for this implementation.

Once I answer your questions, create a comprehensive implementation plan before coding.
