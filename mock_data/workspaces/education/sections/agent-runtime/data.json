Solve: 3x + 5 = 20 (2 pts)\n2. Solve: 2(x - 4) = 18 (2 pts)\n3. Write an equation for: Five more than twice a number is 23 (2 pts)\n4. Solve and graph: x - 7 ≤ -3 (2 pts)\n5. Word problem: A phone plan costs $15 plus $0.10 per minute. Write an equation and find cost for 100 minutes. (2 pts)\n\n### Accommodations for IEP/504:\n- **Reduced items**: Provide 5 key questions instead of 10\n- **Calculator**: Allow for all computation\n- **Formula sheet**: Provide equation-solving steps reference\n- **Extended time**: 1.5x time allowance\n- **Read aloud**: Test items read to student\n- **Scribe**: Student responds orally, scribe records\n\n### Modified Version (Alternative Assessment):\nFor students requiring significant modification, consider a performance task where students demonstrate solving one multi-step equation with verbal explanation of each step.\n\nWould you like a rubric for the word problem or additional modifications?",
